title: Logging
order: 1
---

Logging is provided by logstash and Kibana, backed by ElasticSearch.

## What logging includes out of the box

Configuration for Nginx access log, Ruby on Rails JSON based logs.

Both of these are configured to be shipped to the server remotely by Rsyslog
shipping (agent configuration included as well).


## Credentials Configuration

{% include _common/aws_databag.md %}

### Kibana Credentials

By default, Kibana is protected by HTTP basic auth with username and password.

Create an encrypted data bag for this as well

```
$ bin/knife data bag create kibana credentials --secret-file .chef/encryption_key
```

The keys you need to add are `user` and `password` like so

```javascript
{
  "id": "credentials",
  "user": "USERNAME",
  "password": "PASSWORD"
}
```

## Cookbook configuration

All of the configuration of this cookbook outside of the credentials are stored
in the attributes file

Navigate to `site-cookbooks/stack-logger/attributes/default.rb`

#### Disk configuration

```ruby
default['logger']['disk_count']  = 5
default['logger']['disk_size']   = 1025
default['logger']['raid_level']  = 10
default['logger']['disk_piops']  = 3000
default['logger']['mount_point'] = '/mnt'
```

The logger cookbook will install a 5TB disk with 3000iops, than mount it to
`/mnt`.

Those settings are highly recommended for production since it will acoomodate
your needs loger term.

#### Configuration files

```ruby
override['logstash']['instance']['server']['config_templates_cookbook'] = 'stack-logger'
override['logstash']['instance']['server']['config_templates']          = {
  'syslog' => 'config/syslog_config.conf.erb',
  'rails' => 'config/rails_config.conf.erb',
}
```

Logger comes with Nginx and Rails preconfigured. If you need others please use
this setting and add your confgured files.

#### Nginx configuration

```javascript
input {
  tcp {
    port => "5544"
    type => "syslog"
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    host => "127.0.0.1"
    # protocol => "http"
  }
}

filter {
  if [type] == 'syslog' {
    grok {
      match => {
        message => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}"
        program => "nginx-access"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Rails configuration

If you want your rails application to send logs over to logstash, first install
[logstasher gem](https://github.com/shadabahmed/logstasher) in your
application.

For additional information also read this post:
[http://avi.io/blog/2014/12/15/open-sourcing-the-way-we-centralize-logs-for-our-rails-applications](http://avi.io/blog/2014/12/15/open-sourcing-the-way-we-centralize-logs-for-our-rails-applications)

```javascript
input {
  tcp {
    port => "5545"
    type => "rails"
    codec => json {
      charset => "UTF-8"
    }
  }
}

filter {
  if [type] == 'rails' {
    grok {
      pattern => "<%{POSINT:syslog_pri}>%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:logsource} %{SYSLOGPROG}: %{GREEDYDATA:clean_message}"
    }
    mutate {
      remove => [ "message" ]
    }
    json {
            source => "clean_message"
    }
  }
}
```

Using this configuration you can duplicate and send logs from any application really.

Now that you configured everything, you can continue to adding and
bootstrapping your server

## Adding a server

With everything in the stack, we use terraform to plan and apply changes to the
server list.

First, lets see what we are going to add here.

Navigate to `terraform/base` and execute the following commands

```
$ export MY_IP=`curl -s checkip.dyndns.org | sed -e "s/.*Current IP Address://" -e "s/<.*$//"`">`
$ terraform plan -var key_name=production -var your_ip_address=$MY_IP -target=aws_instance.logger
```

If you did not complete the cluster creation (which is fine) described in [BOOTSTRAPPING THE CLUSTER](/bootstrapping/02-bootstrapping-the-cluster/) you should see something like this in the output.

Once you apply the change, it will create the server and output the public IP,
so lets do that now and create a logstash server.

```
terraform apply -var key_name=production -var your_ip_address=$MY_IP -target=aws_instance.logger
```

This will output a public IP for the logger server, now we can bootstrap our
logger with chef.

```
$ export SERVER_IP=THE_SERVER_IP_YOU_GOT_FROM_TERRAFORM
$ bin/knife bootstrap $SERVER_IP -r "role[base],role[logger]" -E production -x ubuntu --sudo
```

When chef is done, navigate to the URL (server IP or public DNS) and you should
see this:

{% imgcap https://aviioblog.s3.amazonaws.com/screen-shot-2015-08-12-10yin.png %}

Congrats! You have a running server, you can already start shipping logs to
this server, the firewall rules are preconfigured and everything runs smoothly.
