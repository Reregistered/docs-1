Right now, the project is at really early stages. I have only migrated a fraction of the stack to open source, but it's an ongoing effort.

If you have something to contribute, please feel free to do so.

### Feedback

Please be respectful and constructive with feedback you give to others. It is very demotivating to read Github comments that are disrespectful! We are all here for the love of open source, let's not forget that. Be nice!

If you have Feedback/Feature requests about one of the repositories, open an issue/PR in the related project (sub-projects).

When you need to ask a question or create an issue for something that is not directly related to a project (say you want a node.js stack and you want someone's help), open an issue on the docs repo right now. (In the future, I will open a Google group or some other form of discussion forum.)

### Tests

If you are working on one of the stacks' CLI's/Proxies/Servers, you must add tests with your PR. No tests no merge, it's pretty simple.

The purpose of the startup stack is to be production-ready. You should be able to run your startup on it and count on it being stable, so testing is super important.

### Documentation

Write well-written docs for methods, objects, and definitely for features. Good docs mean less issues and less friction for everyone.

### Beginner Friendly

This is maybe an emphasis on the feedback section here, but still worth mentioning. Be very beginner friendly. Even if someone asks a question or posts some bug and it seems really stupid, be friendly and remember you were a beginner once as well.
