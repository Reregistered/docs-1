For the most parts, in order to remain true to the promise that it's really
easy to bootstrap your stack with the startup stack, we will be using [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for whatever databases they provide (currently PG, MySQL etc...).

However, lots of startups are using MongoDB and other databases that are not
included in Amazon's offering.

### Included Databases

#### [MongoDB](/databases/mongodb)

MongoDB is mainly used for MEAN stack, but you can obviously use it for
anything you want.
