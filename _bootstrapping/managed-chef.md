## Chef Management Console as a service

Chef have a management console as a service that you can use for free. It is a great way to get you started, if you are just starting off and you just want to test things out. You might want to try that one first.

Head over to [https://manage.chef.io](https://manage.chef.io) and check it out.

If you do choose this path, all you need is to create your organization, your user, download the `knife.rb` to `~/.chef/knife.rb` and you are basically good to go.
