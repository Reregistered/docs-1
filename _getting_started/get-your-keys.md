Once you have your account opened, entered your credit card and went through
the process of being verified on Amazon, you will need to get your access keys.

The AWS access keys are API keys that allow you to access all the services on
Amazon.

## No Root Access by default

The recommendation is **not** to have a root access key, meaning you should not
create an access key for the admin user (you), alternatively, you need to
create an AIM user and use those access keys.

This is a best practive in order to manage access to resources better.

You can either copy pase or download a CSV and use it to store in a vault or
something like that.

## Secure your keys

Once the keys are created you **cannot** view them, download them or change
them, you can only create new keys, make sure you save those keys in a secure
place.
