Terraform is being used to launch the initial cluster, descirbe security groups and more.

Terraform is absolutely essential in order to manage a cluster of this size, knowing the security groups, making sure all the ports are open when you need them and other useful tasks.

Once you have it installed, we can start really working with our cluster.
